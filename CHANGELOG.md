# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First release of `@talking-avatar/formats` and `@talking-avatar/player`, for the first consumer (Bloodtower). Follows [asset contract v1](docs/asset-contract.md). `@talking-avatar/cli` is not published yet (`"private": true`).

### @talking-avatar/formats

- Zod schemas and types for a character folder: `avatarManifestSchema` (`manifest.json`, with optional `mouthMode`, default `"frame"`), `anchorSchema` (`anchor.json`), and `rhubarbJsonSchema` (Rhubarb timing, now also checking cue order and overlap).
- `validateAvatar(dir)` from `@talking-avatar/formats/node` checks contract rules 1–10 and returns every problem with its rule, file and `line_id`.
- Rhubarb `H` maps to `CONS/EE` when the kit has no `L` (was `EH/AE`), as in the contract.

### @talking-avatar/player

- `<TalkingAvatar manifest lineId baseUrl onEnd />`: plays a line's `.m4a`, samples `audio.currentTime` every animation frame and shows the mouth for the cue at that time (`frame` mode). Captions show the line text without `[pause N]` markup. All mouth frames and timing files load up front. If the browser blocks autoplay, a "Tap to play" button starts the audio.
- `letterAt` and `createMouthClock`, the cue lookup and frame loop behind the component.
- `react` is a peer dependency (`^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`).
